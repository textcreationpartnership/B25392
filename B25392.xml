            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>LIveth a Physician which hath a Pill far beyond any Medicament ever yet known, or at least published; which cureth those diseases so many pretend to, and so few do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, called, the FRENCH POX, and <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> though formerly damnified by poisonous Medicines, wherein Mercury hath been prepared to the danger of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. This Pill by its attractive and mundificative quality clenseth the Patient of what Mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cury he ever received, though of long continuance, by taking any Mercurial Medicine, which is too commonly given by most of the pretended Artists of this Age, which have made the cure prove so dangerous to many, by causing dulness of hearing dimness of fight, black stinking Teeth, and many worse Distempers, which are admired by the Patient from whence they should proceed; when if the Artists understood the nigh and safe way of cure, not any of these bad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects would ever possess the Patient, my Pills take away all Buboes, Nodes, Scabs, Knots in the Head or Face, or any part of the body. This Pill cures all spreading Ulcers, and takes away all pains in the Legs or Arms, though so intolerable that the Patient cannot rest. This Pill cures the Arthritick pains, as pains in the Joynts, and makes the Patient free of all Scorbutick pains which disease is near a kin to the Venerial evil. This pill infallibly prevents the sinking of the Nose, and loosing of the pallat, though in never so great danger, as many have found to admiration, and their great com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ort, after spoiled by the ignorant, and their poisonous Medicines, This pill cures the dulness of hearing, often caused by those dangerous Medicines, wherein Mercury is made the Physicians <hi>Deus.</hi> This pill is to be taken without hindrance of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, for they are taken in the morning, and you may goabout your occasions without let or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and may be taken so privately that your bed-fellow cannot take notice of it. These pills like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prevent these diseases here mentioned, if three or four of them are taken either by Man of woman for two or three mornings after they fear any danger receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

This pill performs these cures with such safety and gentleness that the tendrest and weakest Patient may take them: In short, these pill, should not have bin made publick, but in favor that all may not perish which have not five or ten pounds to lay down for a cure, but may here be cured at a small charge and without hindrance of their employments. Let none despair and think they are too far gon to be cured, for I will warrant a cure, though the disease be old and virulent, so the Patient observe the directions which you shall have with the pill; these pills will keep good two or three years, therefore good for them that are forced into the country, where they may both cure these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases here mentioned or prevent them, if but in danger. These Pills are in Boxes, ftom one s. 6d. the Box, to two shillings 6d. the Box, and so to five shillings the Box, and will be deliver'd to any Person with a little Note of Directions. Likewise this Pill Cures the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> though never so far gone infallibly. Judge not that my Pills are the worse because they are made publick, for a publick way of practice is not my way, although <hi>I</hi> thought good to let this Pill be made known with which I have done great cure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

I have likewise a Sweating Pill which is infallible against all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases where Sweating is good; It is a very great Cordial, and strengtheneth the Patient in Sweating, when other ways of Sweating weakneth, it takes away all pains coming of Cold, and all Venerial pains whatsoever. The Dose of Sweating Pills are two, and the Price 1 s. I take away all Scabs in the Head and Face in three Nights, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

THIS Pill have been published this six or seven years by me, in which time I have cured some thousands with it in this City and Countrey, many which have been given over by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and I never had two Patients that took these Pills that went without their Cure, though their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper was never so Old and Virulent. I detain none from their occasions. I Flux no one let them be never so bad to give any Mercurial Medicine, I Cure all diseases incident to Men, Women, and Children, if Curable.
